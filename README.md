# Paddle Splat
This program is intended to be
a minimal example of a framework that can be used as a template
or a skeleton for more complex games.

## Features Completed
* Standard model-view-controller pattern
* Built on the gloss game and simulation framework
* Programmed entirely in Haskell
* Player actions factored into an API

## Potential Extensions (patterns from Brave Splat)
* Separate modules into self-contained directories and files
* Incorporate game art
* Incorporate sound effects and music 
* Dialog boxes to manipulate options
* Save and Restore Games
* Playback saved games
* Continue saved games 

## Notes
### Scale and Customization
Applying this framework to a game as simple os Paddle Splat
may seem like overkill -- and it is.  But the point is to
promote and understanding of the framework -- how the program
is decoomposed into sparate modules each with specific functions
and responsibilities.  The patterns that arise from separating
in this way are our focues.  These patterns recur and can be
used to organize the code for many different games.  This
re-use of programming patterns should speed development and
aid development.  We can use the same patterns to develop
a family of games by re-using our solutions to common problems
that arise in designing, building, testing, and deploying games
to the game playing community.
